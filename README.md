## Mapping bioacoustic datasets to Camtrap DP

This repository is dedicated to testing the [suggested modifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPODHowsJtEkI8z8GQJKoywU9EWALt_d2ldMNvqA0hM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.f8q281dn4opv) to Camtrap DP by the bioacoustic community. We aim to evaluate these changes by mapping datasets to Camtrap DP.

## Background: Safe and Sound pilot project

The "Safe and Sound" pilot project explored the feasibility of establishing a standard for Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) data, building upon the [Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP)](https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org/), a community-driven data exchange format for camera trap data.

To better understand the types of data generated and their applications, we invited bioacousticians to contribute datasets and share their specific needs. Simultaneously, we analyzed existing PAM standards and databases to identify what information is captured and how it is structured.

**Our findings revealed that Camtrap DP is well-suited for sharing bioacoustic data within the acoustic community and for publishing datasets to GBIF.** There is no need to develop a separate standard. With a few adaptations, the acoustic standard can be seamlessly integrated into Camtrap DP.

The next phase involves testing how these proposed changes impact the entire data lifecycleâ€”from data production to publication, and ultimately to how the data is consumed and analyzed by various tools.
